# Gender Bias in Politics 

Studying gender bias in political discourse is key to understanding socio-cultural barriers to implementing legislation for gender equality. 

In the context of this project, we aim at studying gender bias in the language used by political representatives. We will focus on legislatures from the [French National Assembly](1https://data.assemblee-nationale.fr/) to extract gender bias signals and see howthese evolvewith respect to the proportion of elected women to elected men.
